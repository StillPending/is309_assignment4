## Assumptions

We assume that I_PROJECTâ€™s PCTFREE will be set as 25, as the assignment text only specifies that tables with little or no expansion should use the default values provided in the assignment text (1b).
Also, it is stated in the assignment that there are 267 active projects. We therefore assume that we should multiply active projects by 71 (average donations)  to find the GROWTH per Year for I_DONATION.

We assume that  INITIAL EXTENT SIZE will hold a 1-to-1 ratio with NEXT EXTENT SIZE unless NEXT EXTENT SIZE is very close to the limit.
We assume that the tables with an unknown expansion will stay as 0 expansion in the spreadsheet, in order to make the calculations easier. We remedy this by PCTFREE(value used) to either 5 or 10, depending on which table(s) the table in question has relations to.

## Calculations
Calculation for table growth, x being the specified base amount of items = ((x* 2) * 1.5) / 2 We round up or down when the calculations provide decimals.
